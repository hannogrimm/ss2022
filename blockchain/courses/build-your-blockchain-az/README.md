### Learnings

#### History of Blockchain
The common consensus about the origin of the "blockchain" is attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto for his paper on [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). The underlying cryptographic dynamics of the blockchain, i.e. of linked data blocks, already date back to 1991 by works of Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.
